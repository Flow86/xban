 **
 ** Emergency switch-off:
 ** If a certain temperature is exceeded, or the waterflow is below or
 ** above a limit, the emergency switch will be activated. It is
 ** connected between ATX power switch and mainboard. First a soft
 ** switch-off will be tried (Windows shut down), after a while a hard
 ** switch-off. Limits and times are custom configurable.
 ** 
 ** Analog sensors:
 ** You can connect up to 6 analog temperature sensors, thin foil
 ** sensors (0.4mm) or water temperature probes.
 ** 
 ** Microprocessor:
 ** 
 ** A separate microprocessor is linearising the analog sensors. By
 ** standard analog sensors have strong deviations. But with
 ** linearising, analog sensors get so precise that their perfomance
 ** comes close to that of the digital sensors.
 ** 
 ** I2C-SMBus:
 ** The sensor bus will be connected like the digital sensors over the
 ** bus to the T-Balancer. Analog sensors can be used in addition to the
 ** digital sensors. That sums up to 14 possible temperature sensors.
 ** 
 ** Flowmeter:
 ** You can connect up to 2 flowmeters and configure the puls rate to
 ** ensure a high compability to other flowmeters.
 ** 
 ** Dimensions: 60x35x20mm
 ** Needed Hardware: TBAN-XL or TBAN-SL4
 ** Needed Software: 2.0 (available as Beta at the moment)
 ** Package contents: sensor hub, connection cable, 4 analog foil
 **                   sensors, ATX power switch cable, velcros
 ** 
 ** Please note! For the use of the sensor hub you will need software
 ** version 2 .x
 ** 
 ** The emergency switch-off is included. Additionally thin foil analog
 ** temperature sensors are included. These sensors are very sensitive
 ** to any temperature changes.
